                    <h2>How Machine Learning Works</h2>
                    <p>Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.</p>
                    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
                    <p>Supervised machine learning builds a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Use supervised learning if you have known data for the output you are trying to predict.
                        Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop predictive models.
                        Classification techniques predict discrete responses.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                    <p>Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. It is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning technique. It is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. Applications for cluster analysis include gene sequence analysis, market research, and object recognition.</p>
